# Phaser Test 2

0. Open Visual Studio 2015.
1. Create a new JavaScript > Blank App (Apache Cordova) project.
2. Build new project and confirm it succeeds.
3. Add Phaser to www/scripts directory.
4. Update **index.html** to remove `div.app` and add `phaser.js`.
5. Update **index.js** to replace Cordova default initialization example with Phaser game.
6. Test on desktop.
7. Test on device.

Expected behavior is to see the Phaser logo, with white text above it.
